## What is MentMeet?
A platform to create a **connection** between a **mentor** and a **mentee**, where a mentee gets full **guidance** from the mentor.



## Why we need MentMeet?
Some problems that individuals face are as follows:
1. **Lack of proper guidance** for the future.
2. **Lack of counselling** which can lead to mental issues such as **Depression**.
3. Sometimes it can lead to **fatal consequences**.



## How MentMeet solves these issues?
1. Provides **personalized platform** where mentor and mentee has their own interfaces, specifically designed for the required role.
2. Mentors can **guide** mentees in their own way.
3. Medium for communication can be **Chat**, **Video/Audio** Call.
4. Mentors give **tasks** to Mentees to be done in a given deadline.
5. Tasks make it easier for Mentors to manage **Mentees' progress**, and keeps Mentees motivated throughout the process.



## How is MentMeet different?
1. Mentors can **assign tasks** to Mentees which Mentees have to do within **deadline**.
2. Mentors can **keep track** of the Mentees' progress and act accordingly.
3. Tasks have their own **comment section** where task related chatting can be done between Mentee and Mentor.
4. Mentees get **notified** about new tasks, deadlines, updates and other necessary events.
5. Mentors have a **personalized dashboard** to keep track of **new requests** and **existing Mentees**.
6. Mentors can manage **how many Mentees** at a time he can guide, after which connection to that Mentor will be **disabled** until any Mentee disconnects or Mentor updates the limit.
7. Mentors will have a **score**, which will increase/decrease according to his mentees' progress, reviews from mentees, and other criteria, which will make him **more/less preferred** amongst search results.
8. Mentees will also have a **score**, which will increase/decrease according to the review of the Mentor who guided him for some time, his task completions and other criteria, which will make him **more/less likely** to get accepted by a Mentor.
9. Mentors will get **certified** based on the number of **successfull mentorships**, which can also give him **perk badges** on our platform such as gold, silver, etc.



## Will MentMeet replace any other similar platform?
MentMeet won't replace other platforms, but will serve as an additional platform where people can help each other and get help from others in a more flexible and personalized way.



## How did we come up with this idea?
In final year, many students don't get placed or don't get intern, and the person can't figure it out what to do to get an oppurtunity and get depressed. To overcome this mental health issue, we thought of a platform where detailed and in-depth interaction can be done between a person who can guide and the person who needs guidance.
